        </p>

        <p>
            I hope we always continue on understanding and appreciating one another, lovey, no matter what, because we both know that at the end of the day it is only the two of us who can really love each other. Again and again, I cannot live my life without you, and if I were to pick one person to stay with for the rest of my life, it will always be <span class="highlight">you, Nin.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            As we embark on another month of our relationship, I really hope that we can reach up to our 1st Anniversary, and not just that; I really hope that we can stay together <span class="highlight">up to our last breath.</span>

            Since words cannot truly express how much I adore and love you, I will let this letter come to its end. But as always, I will try my best to make you feel like the luckiest woman and the most beloved girl in this world. Also, I hope that you can appreciate my efforts to you and to us, lovey. I will try my best to show my love to you not just by words, but also by my <span class="highlight">efforts and actions, lovey.</span>
